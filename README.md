# Slow-Rust

Just a little playground to get familiar with Rust programming.

These programs are meant to be straight to the point and not safe to use for real application.

I asked ChatGPT to give me a list of small and simple projects I could do to get my hands dirty with Rust, I should be able to complete a functional version within an hour max.


- [x] Basic Port Scanner: Create a simple tool to scan a range of IP addresses for open ports. This project will help you understand network programming in Rust.

- [x] File Hash Calculator: Develop a utility to calculate the hash (MD5, SHA256, etc.) of files. This is useful in verifying the integrity of files, a common task in security.

- [ ] Command-Line Password Generator: Build a CLI tool to generate random, secure passwords based on user-defined criteria (length, complexity).

- [ ] Directory Watcher: Create a program that monitors a specified directory for changes, like new files or modifications, which is a basic aspect of intrusion detection systems.

- [ ] Simple Packet Sniffer: Implement a basic packet sniffer to capture and display network traffic. It's a fundamental tool in network analysis and security.

- [ ] Log Analyzer: Write a tool to parse and analyze log files (like Apache or Nginx logs) to identify potentially malicious activities.

- [ ] Basic Web Crawler: Develop a crawler to gather information from websites, which can be useful in information gathering phase of security research.

- [ ] Regex Tester: Create a command-line tool to test regular expressions against input text, helpful in data parsing and validation tasks.

- [ ] Encryption/Decryption Tool: Implement a simple tool to encrypt and decrypt text using a chosen algorithm, understanding cryptography in Rust.

- [ ] File System Cleaner: Write a program to clean up temporary files or logs, which can be part of a routine maintenance script for system security.
